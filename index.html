               <p>Mount Rainier, also refered to as Tahoma, is a large active stratovolcano in 
            the Cascade mountain range in the Pacific Northwest. Not only is this the
            tallest mountain in Washington State, it is also the tallest mountain in the
            entire Cascade mountain range.</p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Mount St. Helens</h3>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Mount St. Helens, is an active stratovolcano located in Skamania County, 
               Washington. While it used to stand tall as the 5th tallest mountain in 
               Washington state, that changed during 1980 when the mountain had an extreamly 
               violent eruption, which remains the deadliest and most economically destructive 
               volcanic event in recorded U.S. history.</p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Mount Baker</h3>
               <p>Mount Baker, is an active glacier covered andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade 
               mountain range.  Mount Baker has the second-most thermally active crater in the 
               Cascade Range after Mount St. Helens. After Mount Rainier, Mount Baker has the 
               heaviest glacier cover of the Cascade Range volcanoes;</p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Mount Adams</h3>
               <p>Mount Adams, known by some Native American tribes as Pahto or Klickitat,
               is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Range. Although Adams 
               has not erupted in more than 1,000 years, it is not considered extinct. It is 
               the second-highest mountain in Washington, after Mount Rainier.</p>
