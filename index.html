      <h3>Mount Rainier</h3>
         <p>Mount Rainier, also refered to as Tahoma, is a large active stratovolcano in <br>
         the Cascade mountain range in the Pacific Northwest. Not only is this the<br>
         tallest mountain in Washington State, it is also the tallest mountain in the<br>
         entire Cascade mountain range.</p>

      <h3>Mount St. Helens</h3>
            <p>Mount St. Helens, is an active stratovolcano located in Skamania County, <br>
               Washington. While it used to stand tall as the 5th tallest mountain in <br>
               Washington state, that changed during 1980 when the mountain had an extreamly <br>
               violent eruption, which remains the deadliest and most economically destructive <br>
               volcanic event in recorded U.S. history.</p>

      <h3>Mount Baker</h3>
            <p>Mount Baker, is an active glacier covered andesitic stratovolcano in the Cascade <br>
               mountain range.  Mount Baker has the second-most thermally active crater in the <br>
               Cascade Range after Mount St. Helens. After Mount Rainier, Mount Baker has the <br>
               heaviest glacier cover of the Cascade Range volcanoes;</p>

      <h3>Mount Adams</h3>
            <p>Mount Adams, known by some Native American tribes as Pahto or Klickitat,<br>
               is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Range. Although Adams <br>
               has not erupted in more than 1,000 years, it is not considered extinct. It is <br>
               the second-highest mountain in Washington, after Mount Rainier.</p>
